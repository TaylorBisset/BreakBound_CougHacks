## What is BreakBound
BreakBound is a productivity application that aims to combine the concepts of the **Pomodoro technique** with the **20/20/20 rule**. 
The purpose behind this goal is to decrease eye fatigue and prevent burnout. 
Taking short breaks at frequent intervals has been proven to increase individual productivity and organizational efficiency.
